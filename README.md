The worst game i ever made, here to see (mobile version)

How this code is garbage:
I was 15 years old and never used C#
I followed tutorials from indian men on youtube
I included almost 100mb of game footage...
The lighting is fucked on newer unity versions
Google play games connection is fucked on newer unity versions

How you will use it:
Pls port this monstrosity to unreal or any other game engine i beg to god
Credit me (pls) (thanks) but also this is my worst work so eh maybe not lol
